# Tech Girls are Superheroes

Workshop in Sydney to learn how to make a chatbot on 15 June 2019.

You're going to set up two cloud services: AWS Lex for the bot itself, and AWS Lambda for all of the functions and logic to retrieve information from the back-end software. That's it!

# Getting Started

1. Break into 8 different groups.

2. Open up the instructions written for your group.

    * [Group 1](/docs/group1.md)
